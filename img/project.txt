Implemented global and local decoding algorithm to find the hiddden sequence, a sequence of probabilties matrices that determine the occurance of DNA alphabet in DNA sequences.

Implemented for zero order (the occurance of letters is independent of eachother) and first order where the occurance of letters is dependent on the previous one

Worked using Rstudio and its standard libraries



Created a small program that models the Hodgin Huxley Neuron model

Used object oriented programming concepts in Python to build a program, the program shows users the available options for current, time period and magnitude of current,takes in the user input and use that to model the behaviour of the neuron

Used Python and its standard libraries to devlope the program
